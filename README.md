# Why You Should Vectorize Your Code in R
Using the microbenchmark package in R to compare the efficiency between vectorized operations and for-loops.

In this repo you can see the code used in a post on my blog [Talking Data Science](https://talkingdatascience.com/why-you-should-vectorize-your-code-in-r/)], which was also published in [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-you-should-vectorize-your-code-in-r-d7df86ebc9b7).
